My lifelong passion for technology has led me on an incredible journey through three countries and I could not be more excited to continue my growth here in Canada.

I graduated University with a bachelor’s degree in software engineering in Matanzas, Cuba, after spending a year studying abroad in Chile. While in school I gained experience teaching lectures to my peers.

In Chile I worked for **MasVida** building a document management system to optimize their work efficiency.

After returning to Cuba and completing my studies, I found a niche in the market; cell phone and laptop configurations. As the technological advancements in Cuba grew, I built a database of clients who needed services to keep up with the unique difficulties that came with outdated equipment and data connections.

I moved to Canada in 2021 and got started on building a new client list. I have worked freelancing for companies such as Digital Business Systems Inc. and Cutting Edge Tree Service Inc. where I developed Wordpress plugins and themes, and optimized websites for search engine optimization ranking.

I have also continued to upgrade my skills and acquire new certification through Microsoft and other programs. I have experience in DevOps, back-end and front-end development, and programming. I have expertise in technologies such as Azure, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Node.js, Flask, Django, Wordpress and more.

I am a lifelong student who is always ready to advance my own knowledge and learn the next skill! They say if you pick a career you love, you’ll never work a day in your life.
