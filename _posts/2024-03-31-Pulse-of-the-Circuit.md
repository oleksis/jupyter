[Verse]

In the darkness, the neon lights glow

Electric energy flows through the night (through the night)

Drums beating, synths pulsating, we're caught in the sound

Bodies moving, hearts racing, we're alive (woo-ooh)

[Chorus]

Feel the rhythm, feel the beat (ooh-yeah)

Let the music take control, set us free (set us free)

Join the party, lose yourself in the vibe (woo-ooh)

This is the pulse of the circuit, come alive
